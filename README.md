# Yassss - Yet another simple static site starter
## Built by [Interdiscipline](https://interdiscipline.com) ([Grant Blakeman](https://github.com/gblakeman))

### Basics

**Yassss** is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) app that builds CDN-ready static content with proper asset cache-busting. It assumes deployment to Amazon S3 via CircleCI. In addition to the base Jekyll install, it adds support for a `content` section/tag that is parsed with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It has some opinionated structure to the javascript, sass/css, and the accompanying linting, but that can be easily changed/removed.

The goal of Yassss is simple and unambitious: _provide a quick, easy way to spin up a new static site, using Jekyll, without much tinkering_. It has opinions and maybe you agree with them and will also find it useful.

### Local Setup

Use this repo as a template—no need to clone it or fork it unless you’re planning to contribute.

Be sure to copy `_config.example.yml` and name it `_config.yml`. If you are planning on deploying with CircleCI, leave the `.example` version in place and set your environment variables. Yasss uses specific versions of Ruby and Node. If you’re new to managing multiple ruby/node versions, you may want to check the [Detailed Install](https://github.com/gblakeman/yassss/blob/master/DETAILED_INSTALL.md) instructions.

Install everything with:

`yarn install`

The `bundle install` command will be run first. You can always run it separately as well.

### Deployment

Connect your repo to a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) account.

Make sure the following environment variables are set:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Tweak the `.circleci/config.yml` file to observe the branches you wish to deploy on. By default it deploys to Production when commits are made to `production` and to Staging when commits are made to either `staging` or `master`.

All builds run [HTML Proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) in addition to js/sass linting. You may need to disable it (comment it out in `.circleci/config.yml`) on your first deploy(s) until the site is up and running publicly.

If you are new to static hosting on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), Dustin Curtis has a [great guide](https://dcurt.is/how-to-host-a-static-website-on-aws-with-https) that should get you pretty far.

### Content

Any Markdown files added to the `_content` directory can be called via the `content` tag and will be parsed through the Markdown parser.

```
{% content about.md %}
```

### Assets

Yassss uses the [`jekyll-assets`](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-assets) plugin to manage assets. Place all assets within the `_assets` directory and use the `asset` tag to call them.

```liquid
{% asset yassss.scss %}
{% asset yassss.js %}
```

```css
body {
  background-image: asset_url("test.png");
}
```

```markdown
In a markdown file:

![Cliff]({% asset cliff.jpg @path %})
```

#### Bourbon & Normalize

The default Sass setup takes advantage of [Bourbon](https://www.bourbon.io) and [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css). If you do not wish to use them, remove their references in the core `yassss.scss` file and remove their files from the `_assets/css/vendor` directory.

### Other Jekyll Plugins

Both [`jekyll-sitemap`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) and [`jekyll-feed`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) are included in the basic config and enabled by default. Either or both can be easily disabled/removed based on your needs.
